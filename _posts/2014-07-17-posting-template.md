Go here: http://prose.io/#threeseee/threeseee.github.io/new/master/_posts

This is a good template for posting stuff. If you want to make a new paragraph, put an empty line in. If you want to post an image, do it in this format:

"<img src="IMG-URL" height="200px">"

Obviously, you can change the height to whatever you want. The width sould auto-scale.

To change the filename, just click on it above. It automatically has the format YYYY-MM-DD-YOUR-FILENAME, which you must keep. Though you can obviously edit the "YOUR-FILENAME" part. 

Next, click the middle icon on the left, "Meta Data," and paste in this info:

layout: post

title: Posting Template

category: your-name-here

tagline: "optional, delete line if you want"

tags : [intro, template, how-to]


To save, first hit "unpublished" in the menu bar up top to change it to "publish." Then click the bottom icon on the right. Type your name or something into the box and hit "commit."

And that's all! Check out the question mark thingy above if you have questions.

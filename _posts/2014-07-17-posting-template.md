This is a good template for posting stuff. If you want to make a new paragraph, put an empty line in, 

just like this. If you want to post an image, do it in this format:

<img src="IMG-URL" height="200px">

Obviously, you can change the height to whatever you want. The width sould auto-scale.

To change the filename, just click on it above. It automatically has the format YYYY-MM-DD-YOUR-FILENAME, which you must keep. Though you can obviously edit the "YOUR-FILENAME" part. 

To save, click the bottom icon on the right. Type your name or something into the box and hit "commit."

And that's all! Check out the question mark thingy above if you have questions.
